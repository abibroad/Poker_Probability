4 steps:
1 - generate random 5-card poker hands
2 - check if the generated hand is of certain types
3 - count the occurrence of certain hand-types
4 - present the probabilities.

GENERATE RANDOM 5 CARD POKER HANDS 
- previous exercise

CHECKING HAND TYPES (USING FUNCTIONS)
- Three-of-a-Kind -- 3 cards with the same number
- Four-of-a-Kind -- 4 cards with the same number
- Full-House -- 3 cards with the same number and 2 cards with the same number
- Straight -- 5 cards in numerical order
- Flush -- 5 cards of the same suit
- Straight Flush -- 5 cards of the same suit in numerical order


- You should implement functions, which takes a hand as input, and returns if the hands is of certain types
- Please note that you have to exclude rarer cases during your counting.  E.g., You should not count a hand with four Aces as Three-of-a-Kind;  You should not count a Straight Flush as normal Flush.

Your program should have the global constant NUM_TRIALS.  This indicates the number of hands to be generated in the whole simulation.

Your program should finally console.log the empirical probability you found during your simulation.
i.e., the number of occurrences of certain hand type divided by NUM_TRIALS for each hand-type.
